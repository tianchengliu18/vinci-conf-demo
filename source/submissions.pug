The description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent/qualified graduate student in visual information communication could implement or apply the work and should provide an formal/informal evaluation and discussion regarding its strengths and weaknesses.

        //- p #[strong Research Papers:] A research paper describes a new algorithm, technique, system, or theory that have not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly extended. The description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent/qualified graduate student in visualization could implement or apply the work and should provide an formal/informal evaluation and discussion regarding its strengths and weaknesses.
        p #[strong Art Papers:] This track serves as a link between arts, technology and science by offering creative views and artistic applications. We are especially interested in the submissions that demonstrate tangible and artistic ways of visual information communication, and address information aesthetics. The topics range from experimental and interdisciplinary case studies and methodologies, novel and critical interfaces for VINCI topics to critical analysis of theory and reference works in the field.

Young Talent Summit aims to encourage young potential scholars, such as high school students, to present their original research/findings for the analysis and visualization in the advanced technologies. The topics range from experimental and interdisciplinary applications to critical analysis. There are two formats: short (≤ 4 pages) and poster (≤ 2 pages). The short paper demonstrates an in-depth analysis and a relatively novel contribution, while the poster paper shares alternative approaches, ideas or experiments.

This includes a description of a problem domain, data sets, the questions to be addressed, and describes the application to the task.

        //- p #[strong Tooling/Demonstration Papers:] Papers in this category, apply existing and well known algorithms, techniques, or systems for visual communication and interaction in new application fields/domains or demonstrate specific technical aspects as well as customized software solutions. Submissions should address what will be learned from the demonstration.

We accept project types include data art, generative art, interactive graphics, real-time simulation, scientific illustration, creative and critical visualization, and more. The art gallery call is open-theme, and this year we especially encourage artworks that respond to environmental and health issues or explore the relationship between art and science. Projects that thoughtfully engage with recent popular interests in machine learning, blockchain, and metaverse are also welcome.
        p 
          |Artwork submissions to the Art Gallery should include a 1-to-2-page poster / description / artist's statement. The artwork should be completed within the last 5 years (in or after 2018) and ready to be installed. We do not place restrictions on previously exhibited work, but the accompanying poster / description / statement should not have been published or accepted for publication elsewhere. 

        p 
          | Selected works will be exhibited in the brand new HKUST-GZ Multimedia and XR Spaces. We will further work with selected artists to discuss exhibition logistics and the final display form. Shipping of physical objects is expected to be covered by the artist(s) unless otherwise noted.
