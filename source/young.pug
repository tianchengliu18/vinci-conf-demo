                p #[strong Papers:] This section of the conference serves as a link between young students and Academica by offering creative views and various research applications. Young Talent Summit aims to encourage young potential scholars such as high school students to present their original research/findings for the analysis and visualization in the advanced technologies. The topics range from experimental and interdisciplinary applications to critical analysis. 

                p There are two formats: short (≤ 4 pages) and poster (≤ 2 pages). The short paper demonstrates an in-depth analysis and a relatively novel contribution, while the poster papers share alternative approaches, ideas or experiments.

                p Beyond the difference in length, short papers will favor full academic practices to generate original knowledge, for instance, through an extensive literature review, argumentation, and observations or evaluations of the human impact through validated protocols.


                p #[strong Research Papers:] A research paper describes a new algorithm, technique, system, or theory that have not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly extended. 

                p #[strong Poster Papers:] A poster paper reports on experience made during the applications of existing algorithms, techniques, systems, or theories as possibly alternative approaches to already researched problems in visual communication and interaction. This includes a description of a problem domain, data sets, the questions to be addressed, and describes the application to the task.
