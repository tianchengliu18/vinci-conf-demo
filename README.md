# VINCI website

## 1. Modify the content of the page

All the content of the page is in the `/source` folder and can be modified directly, this page was developed with Pug.js, but all the elements can be found in the existing website that can be used as templates.

Major conference information such as title, year, location as well as submission and notification dates are specified in [conference.json](conference.json).
For submission updates, multiple dates can be specified, with the last beeing used and displayed as latest valid date. Previous dates will be displayed but crossed out.

## 2. Local Development & Testing

To keep the website maintainable, the conference website is static and built using [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) (used to define pages as well as templates with more efficient syntax) and webpack.
In addition, development requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- First, run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies.
- Starting development server: `npm start`
- Building the website: `npm run build` (for testing purposes only).

## 3. Web deployment
